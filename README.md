Redux is a powerful state management library commonly used with React
to manage global application state. 
It allows you to centralize your application's state in a single store,
making state management predictable and easier to debug.
Redux relies on three core principles:
a single source of truth (the store), 
state being read-only (actions describe state changes),
and changes being made with pure functions (reducers). 
By using Redux, developers can efficiently handle complex state transitions and maintain a clear separation of concerns in their applications. 
It's especially useful for larger applications where managing state across multiple components can become challenging.
